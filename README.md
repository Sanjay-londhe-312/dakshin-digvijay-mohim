Dakshin Digvijay Mohim 


Welcome to the Dakshin Digvijay Mohim Interactive Map Project, an exciting project that uses modern technology to bring Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's historical campaign. In this project, we take a deep dive into history and use LEDs and LCD displays to shed light on and explain Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's incredible journey during the Dakshin Digvijay Mohim.

The victories of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in southern India are recorded in history as an example to bravery, intelligent, and leadership. A significant event in his remarkable legacy, the Southern Campaign, also known as Dakshin Digvijay Mohim, signified the Maratha Empire's territorial expansion.

Our project provides a dynamic and accessible link between the past and the present.We hope to bring history to life in a physical and captivating way by illuminating significant sites and dates connected to the Dakshin Digvijay Mohim through the thoughtful placement of LEDs and an informative presentation on an LCD screen.
